# Introduction

This project (tsDetectExtended) is an empirical assessment using an existing test-smell detection tool, named [tsDetect] (https://testsmells.github.io/pages/testsmelldetector-architecture.html), and slight extensions of the tool. Small-scale development activities have been used to improve some of the detection algorithms used within the tool, as well as adding several new test-smell types  for detection.

## Usage manual:
To run the project, run the following command in command-line in the root directory of this project: 
```
java -jar test-smell-tool.jar pathToCsvContainingFilesToAnalyse.csv
